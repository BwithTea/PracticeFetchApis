So this is a project that features a few small sub projects. 
The goal is to learn more about fetching data from various apis.
I have a few pages that are included, but the main page is the products page, where I created a functional product searching app.
This one is similar to the one used at Best Buy. I plan on incorporating new featueres including ai implementation as well. 
This project is a work in progress and has been a ton of fun to work through.
